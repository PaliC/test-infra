    # even though that workflows could have concluded in different ways
    #
    # Definitions:
    #   Start time: When the CI jobs were requested (usually when the dev pushes the commit, can
    #                also be when a label is applied to a commit, or when a workflow is rerun)
    #   End time:   When the dev has an actionable signal. Actionable meaning it's either an
    #                all green signal or it's the first red signal 
    #
    # We filter out jobs that don't contribute to determining the end time of the workflow run
    #
    # The rules used to figure that out:
    #   1. If jobs in a workflow are cancelled before any jobs in CI failed, then the dev
    #       must have pushed a new commit before getting a signal from CI. 
    #       Since they were not blocked on CI, we ignore that entire commit's workflow.
    #       The only exception is when the job duration was >5hrs, in which case they actually
    #       ran into a timeout
    #   2. If a workflow is retried after it failed, then count the entire duration of the workflow
    #       since the dev had to wait for it to complete before doing the retry
    #   2. If any job fails on the final retry attempt then the dev has gotten a signal. Jobs that
    #       succeed or fail after that one are irrelevant
    #   3. If all jobs complete successfully, the last job that completed is what gives the
